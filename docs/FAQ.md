[Click Here](index.md#gaining-access-to-the-makerlab)

## How do I get help or advice making things?
Join The [MakerLab Discord](get_connected.md#join-discord), and then [ask in `how-make`](https://discord.com/channels/639225419639291914/1047280618158960711).

## Can MakerLab 3D print something for me?
MakerLab does not make things for people, we teach them how to use our printers so they can make it themselves. An exception to this are the specialty printers - see their FAQ item further below.

In order to use MakerLab's printers, you need to have taken the *Welcome to MakerLab* course and the *3D Printing* course. Keep an eye on the Campus Groups for when these are scheduled, or ask in the ⁠[general](https://discord.com/channels/639225419639291914/639225419639291916) channel.

Rose offers the Kic3d desk for class projects. If you have a class project and you need parts printed, you can email .stl or .obj files to `kic3d@rose-hulman.edu`.  It is important to note that Kic3D and MakerLab are two separate and unrelated entities, which exist for entirely different purposes.

## Can MakerLab print this poster for me?
MakerLab does not make things for people, we teach them how to use our printers so they can make it themselves.

We have a BN-20 Vinyl print/cutter which can be used to make stickers or iron-on t-shirt designs, but it isn't really meant for posters.

We suggest you send posters to the Rose printing service to be printed instead.
To summarize, the process works like this:

1. You send in the pictures you want and the size you want it in and request to pay by invoice
2. They will print them out
3. They will send you an email when it is printed with the link to the invoice

For more info, contact `posters@rose-hulman.edu` (a separate service from MakerLab)

## How do I get my part resin printed?
Because of the intricacies of resin printing, and the significant chance for hazardous material spills as a result of minor mistakes, the resin printer is not available for general member use. Check out ⁠[resin-print-queue](https://discord.com/channels/639225419639291914/1051964794393079908) for instructions, previous projects, and a place to upload your files. An officer will assist you in printing your parts.

## What if I want something printed on the Ultimaker (MakerLab’s large format Dual Extrusion printer)?
Due to the fact that the Ultimaker S5 costs more than the rest of our printers combined, and the fact that we are not able to repair/service it ourselves, the Ultimaker is not available for general member use.

## How about the x1c?
We do have an X1C, access to this printer is only run by the 3D printer officer. Check out [⁠x1c-print-queue](https://discord.com/channels/639225419639291914/1051968190370029568) for instructions and a place to upload your files so that an officer can assist you with printing.

## What filament does MakerLab have?
Currently (and for the foreseeable future), MakerLab stocks gray MatterHackers Build Series PLA. If you would like to print in a different color or material, reach out to an officer for assistance.
