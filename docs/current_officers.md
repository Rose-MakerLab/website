# Current Officers

The people listed here are official representatives of the MakerLab and are good people to reach out to if you have a particular problem or suggestion. However, if you have a more general problem, it is suggested that you put your message in the [MakerLab Discord](get_connected.md#join-discord) and include `@officer` to ping all officers to make sure they see it.

## Officers
MakerLab Officers are elected by members and are responsible for operating the MakerLab.

## Lab Assistants
Lab Assistants are MakerLab members that want a slightly larger role in the MakerLab. This allows them to help assist in running the MakerLab in ways that are usually reserved for officers without the requirements of formally being an officer or being responsible for operating the MakerLab. Thus, this role is flexible to the needs and desires of the person performing it as long as their actions are supported by the officer who is tasked to manage the relevant element of the MakerLab.
