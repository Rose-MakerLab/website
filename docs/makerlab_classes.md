# MakerLab Classes
All of the classes in the MakerLab are hosetd my our Officers and decided upon in the [Weekly MakerLab Officer Meetings](officer_weekly_meetings.md). If you are intersted in a class that isn't offered, feel free to mention your interest to a MakerLab Officer.

Signing up for classes is done through [Campus Groups](join_discord.md#join-campus-groups) and usually announced on [Discord](join_discord.md#join-the-discord).
