# Who Can Edit?

This page is compiled and deployed from the contends of [this Git Repository](https://github.com/Rose-MakerLab/website), so whomever can edit this repository can edit this website. These people will primarily be MakerLab Officers; however, if you are not in this group you may still propose a change by using a Pull Request. With a Pull Request, you create your own copy of the docs which you are free to edit, and then once you have made your changes an Officer can look over it and decide if they want to apply your edits to the main document.

## Creating a Pull Request
Effectively, you just need to perform the same activities described in [the basic instructions](./Instructions.md).

!!! bug "TODO - Explain this process better"
    This should contain instructions that are easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with git to allow them to quickly make changes to the website and submit their changes to be reviewed and merged, explaining the whole process with images.
