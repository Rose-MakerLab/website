# MakerLab Classes

MakerLab offers many different classes to allow members to gain access to the space and various machines offered. There are also classes to enhance one's skills with a particular machine or gain access to more advanced functionality of the machines which isn't necessary for ordinary use-cases. Classes offered are decided upon in the [Weekly MakerLab Officer Meetings](../officer_weekly_meetings.md).

Signing up for classes is done through [Campus Groups](../get_connected.md#join-campus-groups) and usually announced on [Discord](../get_connected.md#join-discord).

All Classes are offered on an as-needed basis based on officer availability. To request certain classes are hosted, please fill out the following forms.
