# Officer Meetings

MakerLab Officers meet on a weekly basis to deal with issues that occoured over the previous week and plan for the next. This is where we discuss things like spending club money, making administrative decisions, discussing possible changes, and deciding which classes to offer. 

Only the officers are required to attend, but any member interested in having input into how the club is run is allowed and encouraged to attend. For more information, contact an officer about the meeting time or write your message on Discord and include `@officer` to make sure an officer sees it.
