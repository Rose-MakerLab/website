# MakerLab Constitution
Briefly Explain purpose of the constitution

## What you need to know

=== "MakerLab Members"
    The [Active Constitution, linked here](active_constitution.md), is the document explaining how MakerLab should be operated and should be referanced to determine authority and operating procedures. If you notice something out of line with the Constitution, contact the [relevant officer or faculty advisor](../current_officers.md).


=== "Other Clubs/Teams"

    If you want to user MakerLab Tools, Space, or Materials for your club, you need to submit *MakerLab Partner Form* (link to it) which is linked below. This allows us to track who uses the space and what their needs are, so we can more effectivly demonstrate how we assist other groups on campus. 

    How to Complete the form:

    1. Print out the page linked or copy it to a Word Document.
    2. Fill in what you want to use in the MakerLab
    3. Get it to the MakerLab Officers to Review
        - Send it in Email / Discord Message to the [MakerLab President](../current_officers.md).
        - Show up with it to a [MakerLab Officer Meeting](../officer_weekly_meetings.md).
    4. Officers will discuss it in the next  [MakerLab Officer Meeting](../officer_weekly_meetings.md).
        - If the request is reasonable, we will accept it and inform you. (Very likely)
        - If we have an issue with some element of the request, we will bring it up and negotiate something that works for both of us.
        - If the request is unreasonable and can't be negotiated, we will reject it. (unlikely)
    5. If you want to change the terms, repeat this process with the new terms and when it is agreed to, it will replace the old agreement.
