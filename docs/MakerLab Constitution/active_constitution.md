is not an official instructor is deemed inadequate. Members of MakerLab partner clubs are subject to the same training requirements as any other MakerLab member.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual image, deliberate intimidation, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
4. Sexual language and imagery (as defined by Institute policy) are not appropriate at any time.
5. Members are expected to assist in maintaining the cleanliness of the space by returning tools and material to the correct locations and correctly disposing of waste. Members are encouraged to leave the space cleaner than they found it.
6. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the group at the discretion of the officers and their membership revoked through the procedure laid forth in Article II.
