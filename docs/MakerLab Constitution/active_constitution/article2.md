### **^^II.1.c:^^** Removal of membership
#### **^^II.1.c.1:^^** Grounds
The revocation of membership should be considered an extreme remedy and used only sparingly. Membership may be removed for the following reasons:

- Repeated interference with the mission and purpose of the organization.
- Violation of the constitution and bylaws of the organization.
- Blatant disregard for the safety rules, including taking clearly hazardous actions that are not explicitly prohibited.
- Violation of life critical safety procedures. This includes reckless use of compressed air or flammable materials.

#### **^^II.1.c.2:^^** Procedure
To revoke the membership of an individual the following procedure will be followed:

- A club member must request a public hearing and present evidence of why the individual’s membership should be revoked.
- The individual in question may argue a defense and present counter evidence at the hearing or may request a separate hearing to allow time to prepare a defense.
- The officers will discuss and weigh the evidence. If the officers find the evidence against the individual strong enough, they may revoke membership with a 2/3rds majority vote.
- After the officers revoke membership, the President shall inform BIC leadership about the revocation of membership and provide any evidence collected in the public hearing process.

#### **^^II.1.c.3:^^** Alternative Procedure
The faculty advisors may unanimously decide to revoke membership. In this situation a public hearing is not required if it would violate institute policy or is determined to be inappropriate by the faculty advisors.

## **^^II.2:^^** Partnership

- Are in good standing with the Institute and the Innovation Centers.
- Are willing to follow the partnership agreement when it is finalized.

### **^^II.2.b:^^** Procedure to establish club partnership
- A representative of the potential partner club will contact the MakerLab President.
- If the President agrees that partnership would be mutually beneficial, representatives of the club will meet with the MakerLab officers.
- Before the meeting it is strongly suggested that the MakerLab President and potential partner club draft a simple partnership agreement that includes details on the goals of the partnership, details of tool use, and the terms of using MakerLab material. A sample partnership agreement is included in Appendix A.
- During this meeting the details of the partnership agreement will be discussed, an official partnership agreement drafted, and a vote taken.
- If a majority of the other MakerLab officers, along with President, vote in favor of the agreement the partnership becomes official as outlined in the partnership agreement.

### **^^II.2.c:^^** Benefits of partnership
Besides the specific benefits outlined in the partnership agreement, all partner organizations receive the following benefits:

### **^^II.2.d:^^** Removal of partnership
