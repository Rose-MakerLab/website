# Article III: Code of Conduct
*Members expected to foster an atmosphere of welcoming and creativity towards everyone.*

1. Members are expected to never act in such a way as to interfere with the goals of the organization. This includes blatant disregard of other members, safety policies of the club, and equipment.
2. Training on equipment must be given by an official instructor of the MakerLab during an official MakerLab class. Training received outside of such classes or given by someone who
is not an official instructor is deemed inadequate. Members of MakerLab partner clubs are subject to the same training requirements as any other MakerLab member.
3. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual image, deliberate intimidation, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
4. Sexual language and imagery (as defined by Institute policy) are not appropriate at any time.
5. Members are expected to assist in maintaining the cleanliness of the space by returning tools and material to the correct locations and correctly disposing of waste. Members are encouraged to leave the space cleaner than they found it.
6. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the group at the discretion of the officers and their membership revoked through the procedure laid forth in Article II.
7. If anyone sees harassment, or has any other concerns, they must contact an officer immediately.
