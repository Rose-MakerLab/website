# Article IX: Facility and Equipment
## IX.1) Space Management
The Lab Director oversees organizing the area and promoting organization. The Lab Director shall work with the Treasurer and equipment managers to maintain an inventory of the MakerLab’s supplies and equipment. The record should be kept in an electronic form so it can be easily transferred to the next generation of officers.
## IX.2) Storage Space
- The space is not allowed to be used as permanent storage for students or clubs except where specifically allowed in a partnership agreement.
- The Lab Director must record the contact information of the members and their materials that are stored in the Lab temporarily.
- The organization will not be responsible for any member’s personal items.
- Members must confirm that they understand the consequences of using MakerLab storage before storing anything.
- At the end of the spring quarter, an email will be sent out to the members that have their projects stored in the Lab. Members can either donate their materials to the Lab or take them back. If the members need to store their materials over the summer, the Lab Director may grant approval to do so.
- Materials that are left in the Lab for more than two years or left after graduation will be considered as owned by the Lab. The member will not be able to get them back. At least 7 days before such action, the member will be warned via their RoseHulman email address or last known contact information.
## IX.3) Space Safety
1. The Lab Director and Equipment Managers are responsible for maintaining safety documents for all equipment in the space. These documents should be reviewed on a yearly basis for accuracy and relevance.
2. Overall information
    - The tools and equipment located in the space are inherently dangerous and misuse could result in serious injury, loss of property, or death. The Officers and members of MakerLab have a responsibility to understand these risks and understand the procedures put in place to reduce harm in the event of an incident.
    - Specific safety training for our larger machines (Laser cutter, CNC router, Vinyl printer, sewing machines, etc.) will be given by their respective Officers. Once a member has received training, the Officer involved will record the member’s name, equipment the training is for, and date the training took place on.
    - Equipment training must be renewed by all members, including officers, on an annual basis for all equipment said member / officer wishes to operate.
    - A list of emergency contacts and an incident response guide will be kept in a prominent location in the MakerLab.
