# Policies
The following policies are maintained to ensure some consistancy in the operation of the MakerLab. These policies may be changed at any time by the MakerLab Officers unless they have been written into the [MakerLab Constitution](../MakerLab%20Constitution/active_constitution.md) or some other agreement has been made. If you want to suggest a change, send a message to an officer on Discord or show up to [an Officer Meeting](../officer_weekly_meetings.md) to explain it.
