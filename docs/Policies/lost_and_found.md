# Lost & Found Policy

Use the slips provided in MakerLab. 

If we have run out of slips, you can print one [from the PDFs here](../Public%20Documents/project_slip_printout.md).

    **Authority:** MakerLab Officers

## Content pasted from the Procedure Sign in the MakerLab
If you have a need to leave something in the MakerLab, and the Totes and Bins provided don’t fit your needs, you can do this on a temporary basis. To do this, you need to identify the object with a “Project Slip”  (see image below). 

The Project Slip needs to be filled out, clearly visible, and near the project. We suggest you physically attach the slip to the project if possible. 

The process used to determine what to do with an item when found in the MakerLab space is described in the flowchart below. MakerLab Officers are primarily responsible for performing this process. If the maximum pickup date is exceeded on a slip, it will either be corrected without notification, or treated as if the pickup date passed (at officer discretion).

Maximum Pickup Period - The maximum time between the current date and pickup date, (exclude current date, include pickup date)
(e.g. 3 days:   03/01 - 03/04)

- 3D Print: 1 week
- Other: 3 days

```
Date Format:
MM/DD/YYYY
e.g. March 14, 1592 -> 03/14/1592
```
